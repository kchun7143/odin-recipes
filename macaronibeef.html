    <h2> Description</h2>
    This macaroni beef soup recipe is very comforting and easy to make. <br>
    This recipe will take about an hour to make and it only requires 11 ingredients.<br>
    When making Macaroni Beef Soup, the noodles can be made in a separate pot<br>
    and it can be later added to prevent the noodles from soaking up all the liquid.<br>
    I prefer my noodles to be soaked because it reminds me of Macaroni Beef T.V. dinners<br>
    that you get from the freezer aisle at the grocery store.<br>
    I hope you enjoy this dish as much as I do. <br>
